During my time at UCL as an undergraduate, I had the chance to spend many years exploring the nuances and hidden gems of this wonderful city. Using the money I made during working for Credit Suisse as a summer analyst, I was able to experince some of the finest restaurants in the world, such as [Aqua Kyoto](https://aquakyoto.co.uk/experience)

Further, for my birthday, I was gifted a chance to cook with Gordon Ramsey at his [bread street kitchen restaurant](https://www.gordonramsayrestaurants.com/bread-street-kitchen/). The night ended in none other than [loop](https://www.theloopbar.co.uk/london), one of UCL's most notorious student night clubs.
