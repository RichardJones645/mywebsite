<h3><em>Cape Town</em></h3>
<p>I have been dating my girlfriend for more than 3 years now, and last summer I had the <strong><em>slightly terrifying</em></strong> opportunity to meet her parents for the first time. Luckily, being from Cape Town, this meant a chance to visit the wonderful city. During my stay I had the chance to go whale watching, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=boulders+beach&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvLOpsEI4rucCx9ejyCJ1ZaYFlT5Yg:1634837190311&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiBsPmPg9zzAhUiD2MBHapYDJQQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1504&amp;bih=803&amp;dpr=1.5">penguin watching</a>, and go to the game reserves where I was luckily enough to see the ‘big 5’ up close and personal.</p>
