### *Professional*  

Some day in the future, after first becoming an MD at an investment bank and learning the ropes, I would like to establish my own boutique investment bank in the city. On the side, I would like to volunteer at the [Battersea Dog's home](https://www.battersea.org.uk/)


### *Leisure*  

Being a huge fan of the [Mumford and Sons](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+mumford+and+sons&sxsrf=AOaemvLsjT_2cWCucYQP0DuQh1iHxVn_mw:1634837880674&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjs2ZHZhdzzAhXvB2MBHbHOARkQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1504&bih=803&dpr=1.5) I would someday like to follow them on a world tour to all of their gigs. I think it would be a wonderful way to discover new cities and cultures whilst listening to some great music.
