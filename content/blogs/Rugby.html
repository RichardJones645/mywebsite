<h3><em>Rugby</em></h3>
<p>During my time at Hutton Grammer School I fell in love with playing rugby. I soon joined <a href="https://tarletonrugby.com/">Tarleton Rugby Club</a>. This club helped me to develop my form and become successful as a fly-half, so much so that I soon went on to represent my county, Lancashire, and the North of England.</p>

<p>Last year, when I wasnâ€™t enjoying all that lockdown had to offer, I spent a lot of time in the sky flying around the South of England as a member of the <a href="https://studentsunionucl.org/clubs-societies/gliding-club">UCL Gliding Society</a>.</p>
