### *Cape Town*  

I have been dating my girlfriend for more than 3 years now, and last summer I had the ***slightly terrifying*** opportunity to meet her parents for the first time. Luckily, being from Cape Town, this meant a chance to visit the wonderful city. During my stay I had the chance to go whale watching, [penguin watching](https://www.google.com/search?q=boulders+beach&sxsrf=AOaemvLOpsEI4rucCx9ejyCJ1ZaYFlT5Yg:1634837190311&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBsPmPg9zzAhUiD2MBHapYDJQQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1504&bih=803&dpr=1.5), and go to the game reserves where I was luckily enough to see the 'big 5' up close and personal.
