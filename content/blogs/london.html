<p>During my time at UCL as an undergraduate, I had the chance to spend many years exploring the nuances and hidden gems of this wonderful city. Using the money I made during working for Credit Suisse as a summer analyst, I was able to experince some of the finest restaurants in the world, such as <a href="https://aquakyoto.co.uk/experience">Aqua Kyoto</a></p>
<p>Further, for my birthday, I was gifted a chance to cook with Gordon Ramsey at his <a href="https://www.gordonramsayrestaurants.com/bread-street-kitchen/">bread street kitchen restaurant</a>. The night ended in none other than <a href="https://www.theloopbar.co.uk/london">loop</a>, one of UCLâ€™s most notorious student night clubs.</p>
